# Fetus Classification using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for classifying fetal health based on medical or ultrasound data. Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture implemented in PyTorch, the project performs preprocessing, training, and evaluation on a given dataset. It also explores hyperparameter optimization using random search for improved performance.

### Key Features
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes label encoding and standardization of input features.

Configurable MLP Model: Allows flexible architecture tuning with multiple hidden layers and neurons.

Training and Evaluation: Provides real-time tracking of loss and accuracy during training and testing.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Implements random search to optimize batch size, learning rate, and model architecture.

Results Visualization: Demonstrates the impact of different configurations on model performance.
